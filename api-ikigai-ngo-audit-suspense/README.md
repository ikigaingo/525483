## Features

- **Create Audit**: Allows the creation of a new audit record.
- **Read All Audits**: Retrieves a list of all audit entries.
- **Read Audit**: Retrieves a specific audit entry by ID.
- **Update Audit**: Updates an existing audit record.
- **Delete Audit**: Removes an audit record from the system.
